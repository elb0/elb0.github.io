A collection of interesting resources, recommendations and bits and bobs from the 10th International Conference on Teaching Statistics (ICOTS) in Kyoto, Japan, 8 - 13 July. Thanks to the University of Auckland's Department of Statistics for funding my attendanc, and to my amazing co-author Anna Fergusson, [@annafergussonnz](https://twitter.com/annafergussonnz), for letting me work with her.

## Notes from Session 3A (UNDER CONSTRUCTION)

### Data Science for ALL - a stroll in the foothills by Jim Ridgway, University of Durham

**Take homes**: Just because there is a new game in town, doesn't mean you should forget everything you know. There are new models and new modellers, so adaptation is necessary to stay relevant.

The roots of our discipline come from people wanting to tackle real problems using evidence and collaborate with anyone sympathetic. But more recent critiques suggest we're stuck in the early 1900s.

"More and different data (open data, text, images, sensor data...)"

Are Statistics and Computing "worlds in conflict"?

The Death of Theory, (Anderson 2008). ![Photo quote]

Challenges - new analytic techniques, black box models, unanticipated consequences.

Modelling is process NOT content.

"arithmetic is actually a very dangerous thing to teach people as it can be applied in all sorts of bad way". If I have a letter for house 12 and one for house 8, I can put both in the letter box for house 20 and be done with it.

Tom Leher quote - life is like a sewer. This is a problem for algorithmic models.

**Ridgway's 3 modelling styles**
  - Linear, additive (e.g. school physics)
  - Systems models (e.g. school biology)
  - Macro-systemic models (e.g. evolution of the earth; Trump; Brexit) - unstable over time, layers of systems, VERY vulnerable to error

"Models should be viewed as ephemeral things, NOT rock sculptures"

**Data Science: Supporting Evidence Informed Decision making**
  - Problem exploration
      - Large scale datasets
      - Data visualisation
  - Data collection
      - Measurement issues (what IS poverty?)
  - Analysis
      - What tools?
  - Decision making
      - 'What if?', what are the consequences? how will people 'game' the system?

Sampling - just having a big sample doesn't save you. Who are you trying to generalise to?

### Teaching Statistics in the Era of Data Science by Alison Gibbs, University of Toronto
[@AlisonLGibbs](https://twitter.com/AlisonLGibbs)

Data science as at the intersection of statistics, computation and domain expertise. Want students to develop a rigorous mindset plus more computational and algorithmic thinking, more real world problems.

"Never become so much of an expert that you stop gaining expertise. View life as a continuous learning experience" - Denis Waitley. A good quote to describe adaptive experts. Flexible, innovative, a mindset for continuous learning and can take their knowledge and expertise and work in new contexts.

"A subject area is ultimately about the doing of a subject - using the content in a disciplined way...[not] a march through content." - Wiggins and McTighe

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">How can we help our students develop adaptive expertise? Something they will need for the jobs (and lives?) of the future.

Small group tutorials are just as important as lectures. Tutorials have an emphasis on communication and group work.

### Challenges and opportunities for undergraduate data science major and minor degree programs by Jo Hardin, Pomona College
[@jo_hardin47](https://twitter.com/jo_hardin47)

Donoho 2017 article, on greater data science.
Jo's goal for this talk: You will update something in everything class you teach, every time you teach it.

A survey of statistical capstone projects paper - find this article!

**Update 1: Go through a full data analysis**
This could be through a capstone project, Datafest, ASA Data Expo competition, [kaggle](https://kaggle.com), [Her Hoop Stats](https://herhoopstats.com/)

**Update 2: Computation in statistical theory**
Including simulation makes a big difference to student understanding.

**Update 3: Ethics**
Weapons of Math Destruction

Great Wald story about bullet holes on planes. Where do you reinforce a plane? Where there aren't any bullet holes on the planes you can salvage.

"Crime data doesn't exist...the only things we have is arrest data"

**Update 4: New/augmented learning outcomes**
Like confounding and cross validation!

**Update 5: Faculty development**
Use the tidyverse.

**Update 6: Reproducibility**
Use R and R Markdown, Git and GitHub. "If they don't know Git an GitHub, they're not getting jobs".

**Update 7: Visualisation**
Not doing it badly, and/or doing it in sophisticated ways and/or doing it creatively.
