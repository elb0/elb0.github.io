A collection of interesting resources, recommendations and bits and bobs from the 10th International Conference on Teaching Statistics (ICOTS) in Kyoto, Japan, 8 - 13 July. Thanks to the University of Auckland's Department of Statistics for funding my attendanc, and to my amazing co-author Anna Fergusson, [@annafergussonnz](https://twitter.com/annafergussonnz), for letting me work with her.
