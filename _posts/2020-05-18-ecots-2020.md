(Work in progress) A collection of notes, resources, recommendations and more from eCOTS 2020 (Electronic Conference on Teaching Statistics). See the full program [here](https://www.causeweb.org/cause/ecots/ecots20/program).

## Liza's one sentence summary
These are my session notes from my first ECOTS experience, as well as a list of resources to help me keep track of all the things I want to check after this conference, that I hope might help you too.

## W01: Multivariable thinking across the curriculum
*2020-05-18 11:00*  
*Beth Chance, Elena Keeling, Karen McGaughey, Jamie Bunting (Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo); Nathan Tintle (Dordt University)*

I love the idea of the two bogs! I think it would be interesting to ask students which bog they're more at risk of falling in...

### Bog of overconfidence
- Over emphasise p-value criteria

### Bog of disbelief
- Hope for a miracle
- Not understanding what is going on behind the scenes
- Hope for a miracle


### Examples from biology
- Making sure language is consistent across the Statistics and Biology courses students are taking so that their aren't barriers to understanding. "Statisticians & biologists use the same words to mean different things, and different ords to mean teh same things".
- Statistical signficance vs. biological revelance. The connections and distinctions needs to be made clear.

### Multivariable thinking in a second statistics course
- Thinking about sources of variation
    - Have students predicts changes with data visualisations, show blocking/confounding
- A second stats course is often taught as disparate methods, how do you weave this together into a unified approach?

### Multivariable thinking in an introductory statistics course
I especially likes the emphaisis on discussing things like study design, sources of variation, as a way to 'engage everyone' (theme of this eCOTS), as it opens up contributions from a wider range of students. I also think this is tha path to 

### Advice on finding datasets
- Keep an eye on teh NYT Science section

## Engaging Everyone: Context, Communication, Connections and Commitment
*2020-05-18 13:00*  
*Roxy Peck, Professor Emeritas, Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo*

### Context strategies

- Some contexts may be disruptive to learnign for some students. Examples given: depression, immigration status.
- Choose a path homework problems.

### Combating anti-statistical thinking using simulation-based methods throughout the undergraduate curriculum

#### Abstract
The use of simulation-based methods for introducing inference is growing in
popularity for the Stat 101 course, due in part to increasing evidence of the methods ability to improve students' statistical thinking. This impact comes from simulation-based methods (a) clearly presenting the overarching logic of inference, (b) strengthening ties between statistics and probability or mathematical concepts, (c) encouraging a focus on the entire research process, (d) facilitating student thinking about advanced statistical concepts, (e) allowing more time to explore, do, and talk about real research and messy data, and (f) acting as a firmer foundation on which to build statistical intuition.

Thus, we argue that simulation-based inference should be an entry point to an undergraduate statistics program for all students, and that simulation-based inference should be used throughout all undergraduate statistics courses. In order to achieve this goal and fully recognize the benefits of simulation-based inference on the undergraduate statistics program we will need to break free of historical forces tying undergraduate statistics curricula to mathematics, consider radical and innovative new pedagogical approaches in our courses, fully implement assessment-driven content innovations, and embrace computation throughout the curriculum.
