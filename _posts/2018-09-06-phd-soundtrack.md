A selection of songs with lyrics or messages I like for getting through PhDing.

As of writing I am not yet someone who has 'got through' a PhD, but I do have less than a year to go. It is also my mum's birthday this week, and she's a big influence on my music tastes - so this one is for you mum!

## My playlist

## Why?

I'm a big lyrics person, so a lot of the reasons I've chosen these songs are because of the words.

The songs are sort of grouped in 5 themes:
- Writing
- I am/will be awesome
- Mental health songs
- Songs about knowing/not knowing stuff
- Perseverance songs

### Writing

**Non-stop, Various, Original Broadway Cast of Hamilton**

I've talked briefly [elsewhere](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/students/academic-information/postgraduate-students/school-of-graduate-studies/doctoral-spotlight0.html) about loving the Hamilton soundtrack. I'll listen to the whole thing through while doing data analysis, and know it's time to go home when I'm the last person in the office and crying through the final song, "Who Live, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story". If I had to only pick one song from it for PhDing, Non-Stop wins hands down.

> *"Why do you write like you’re running out of time?
> Write day and night like you’re running out of time?"*

Big thanks to my dad for taking me to see the musical in Chicago when I was there for a PhD-related conference.

**Paperback Writer, The Beatles**

I can't find a song called "Thesis Writer", but the opening lines of "Paperback Writer" seem quite appropriate for it:
> *Dear Sir or Madam, will you read my book?
> It took me years to write, will you take a look?"*

**I Could Write a Book, Ella Fitzgerald**

This song also fits in the *Songs about knowing/not knowing stuff* with the great little opening. I sure feel like I can't spell or count a lot more than I think is strictly good for someone with as many years of education as I supposedly have. But...

> *But my busy mind is burning to use what learning I've got
> I won't waste any time
> I'll strike while the iron is hot

> If they asked me, I could write a book*
